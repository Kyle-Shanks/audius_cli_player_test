# Notes and things

## Useful Things
- This is a super useful article about how to use commands
    - https://charm.sh/blog/commands-in-bubbletea/

## TODO
- Write a system to add the track Id to the filename when downloading and then only deleting all of the temp files on quit
    - Also check to see if we have the track file before playing to skip downloading again
- Add fetching/loading state to table and player
- Need to create a styles file for general styles used between components
- Add help text for commands around the app
- Would be cool to add click events to change the track position
- Figure out how to use goroutines properly to make the ui not freeze when fetching and playing tracks
- 
- Update the help text to display things for search and stuff
- Add queue methods in player
- Update the main view names to page
- Update the keymap system to have the player and the pages handle all of the keymapping except for quit and toggle help
- Update the tracks table to save the column titles to dynamically get the info from the tracks
- Need to use commands for async things


## Goals

- Search Page for searching tracks
- Playlist/Album View
- Searching for albums and playlists
- Global controls and Help text
    - Top level help text for sure
    - Help text in specific places as needed
- Queueing System
    - Queue View to manage queue
- User Login
    - User Favorites
    - User Playlists
    - Favoriting Tracks
- Mouse interaactions would be cool once all of the ui is nailed down
