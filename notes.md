# Notes and things

## TODO
- Write a system to add the track Id to the filename when downloading and then only deleting all of the temp files on quit
    - Also check to see if we have the track file before playing to skip downloading again
- Add fetching/loading state to table and player
- Need to create a styles file for general styles used between components
- Add help text for commands around the app
- Would be cool to add click events to change the track position
- Figure out how to use goroutines properly to make the ui not freeze when fetching and playing tracks
